        "Malware is short for malicious software. It refers to any code or software designed to harm devices, steal data, or disrupt systems. It can come in many forms, including programs, scripts, or exploit code, and can spread through infected files, emails, websites, or networks.",
        "Malware can be hidden inside files, links, or even apps that seem safe. Once installed, it can slow down your device, steal passwords, or lock files so you cannot access them.",

        "Some malware spreads on its own, while others trick people into installing them.",

        "Viruses: A virus is a type of malware that starts when a user downloads or opens an infected file, such as an email attachment or a file from an unsafe website. Once active, it attaches itself to files and spreads when those files are opened. It can damage files, slow down computers, or make them crash. Some viruses are created just to cause chaos, while others delete important system files. Unlike some other malware, viruses do not usually steal personal data or give hackers control over a device.",

        "Trojan horses: Unlike viruses, Trojans do not spread by themselves. Instead, they trick users into installing them by pretending to be useful programs, like a free game or an update. Once inside, a Trojan can secretly steal passwords, spy on the user, or allow hackers to take full control of the computer.",

        "Ransomware: This malware locks files and demands money (a ransom) to unlock them. It usually spreads through fake downloads or phishing emails, not by infecting other files like a virus.",

        "Not all malware is a virus. A virus is just one type of malware, along with Trojans and ransomware. Other types include adware, which shows unwanted ads; worms, which spread across networks without needing user action; and keyloggers, which secretly record what you type to steal passwords and personal information. Some other common ones we will cover in the course are rootkits, which hide deep inside the system to avoid detection; botnets, which turn infected computers into part of a hacker-controlled network; and scareware, which tricks users into paying for fake security software.",

      sectionTitle: "Signs That a Computer Has Malware",
      content: [
        "A computer infected with malware often shows warning signs that something is wrong. One of the most common symptoms is a significant slowdown in performance, even when no large programs are running. Malware can consume system resources, causing lags, crashes, or unresponsive applications.",

        "Another clear sign of infection is the appearance of random pop-up ads, even when you're not browsing the internet. Malware can also redirect your browser to unknown websites or change your default search engine without permission. These changes often indicate that a malicious program is interfering with your system.",

        "Files going missing or unexplained new files appearing are additional red flags. Some malware can delete, encrypt, or move files without user input, while others create unwanted programs in the background. If you notice these symptoms, it's important to scan your device for threats immediately.",

      sectionTitle: "How to Protect Your Computer from Malware",
      content: [
        "Just like washing hands prevents sickness, good cybersecurity habits protect your computer from malware. Be cautious with emails and attachmentsâ€”hackers often send fake messages containing malicious links or files. If an email seems suspicious or unexpected, delete it without clicking anything.",

        "Only download software from official or trusted sources. Many free downloads from unknown sites or pop-up ads contain hidden malware. Keeping your operating system and apps updated is equally important, as security updates fix vulnerabilities that hackers exploit. Enable automatic updates whenever possible to stay protected.",

        "Using a reputable antivirus program adds an extra layer of protection. Personal users often rely on lightweight solutions like Malwarebytes or Windows Defender, which protect against viruses, phishing attempts, and suspicious websites. These tools automatically block access to dangerous websites and display a warning, allowing users to decide whether to proceed. They also quarantine suspicious files if downloaded, preventing them from running until the user manually approves or removes them. Small businesses (SMBs) need stronger security solutions like Bitdefender GravityZone or Avast Business, which include centralized management, real-time email protection, and automatic quarantine of potential threats. Large enterprises require full-scale security suites such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or CrowdStrike Falcon, which use AI-driven threat detection, behavior-based scanning, and advanced network monitoring to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks.",

        "While antivirus programs help block and remove threats, malware often enters systems through human error. Businesses and individuals should focus on building strong cybersecurity habits, such as avoiding untrusted downloads, verifying links before clicking, and using secure passwords. Combining antivirus software with safe browsing habits, employee training, and regular system updates provides the best protection against malware infections.",

        "If you suspect malware on a device, act quickly to minimize the damage. First, disconnect from the internet to prevent the malware from spreading or sending data. Then, restart your computer in Safe Mode to limit malware activity before running a full system scan with a reputable antivirus program.",

        "If malware is found, delete any suspicious files or programs. Uninstall unfamiliar apps, clear your browser's cache and extensions, and reset your security settings if needed. Finally, change your passwords, especially for important accounts, and enable multi-factor authentication to prevent further access.",
