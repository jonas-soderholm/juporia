      sectionTitle: "What is Penetration Testing?",
      content: [
        "Penetration testing (pen testing) is a security practice where ethical hackers simulate cyberattacks on a business's systems to find and fix vulnerabilities before real hackers exploit them. Unlike cybercriminals, ethical hackers work with permission to help improve security, not cause harm.",
        "Pen tests help businesses identify weak spots in their websites, networks, and software. They provide valuable insights into how hackers could break in and what defenses need to be strengthened. For example, a company hiring a penetration tester may discover that an employee database is exposed due to a weak password, allowing them to fix it before a real attack happens.",

      sectionTitle: "Why is Pen Testing Important for SMBs?",
      content: [
        "Many small businesses assume they are too small to be hacked, but in reality, they are prime targets because they often have weaker security. A penetration test helps businesses find gaps in their defenses before attackers do.",
        "SMBs can use pen testing to check if employees are using strong passwords, if their firewalls are effective, and if hackers could steal sensitive customer information. For example, a small retail business might discover through testing that its online store has an outdated plugin that allows hackers to inject malicious code.",

      sectionTitle: "Types of Penetration Testing",
      content: [
        "Pen testing is done in different ways depending on the type of threats a business wants to defend against. The most common types include:",
        "1. Network Penetration Testing – Tests the security of company networks, routers, and firewalls to check if hackers can break in. Example: A tester finds that the company’s Wi-Fi password is too weak, allowing an attacker to access internal files.",
        "2. Web Application Testing – Checks websites and apps for security flaws like SQL injections and cross-site scripting (XSS). Example: A tester discovers that the business’s login page is vulnerable, allowing hackers to steal customer credentials.",
        "3. Social Engineering Testing – Simulates phishing attacks to see if employees fall for scams and give away sensitive information. Example: A tester sends a fake email pretending to be IT support and sees if employees reveal their passwords.",

      sectionTitle: "How is a Penetration Test Performed?",
      content: [
        "Penetration tests follow a structured process to simulate real-world attacks. The goal is to find vulnerabilities, exploit them in a controlled way, and report findings to the business so they can improve security.",
        "The main steps of a penetration test include:",
        "1. Planning – The ethical hacker defines the scope of the test, deciding which systems will be tested and what methods will be used.",
        "2. Scanning – The tester scans the network and applications to find weaknesses such as open ports, outdated software, or misconfigured security settings.",
        "3. Exploitation – The tester attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, just like a hacker would, to see how far they can go. This may involve bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, or extracting sensitive data.",
        "4. Reporting – After testing, the ethical hacker provides a report detailing what was found, how the vulnerabilities were exploited, and how the business can fix them to improve security.",

      sectionTitle: "Ethical Hacking vs. Malicious Hacking",
      content: [
        "Ethical hackers use the same skills as cybercriminals, but with permission and for good purposes. They follow strict rules and guidelines to help businesses improve security, while malicious hackers aim to steal data, disrupt services, or cause damage. Hacking without explicit permission is highly illegal and can result in severe legal consequences, including fines and prison time.",
        "Businesses should only work with certified ethical hackers who follow legal and professional standards, such as those holding Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) or Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certifications. For example, a company hiring an ethical hacker should ensure they sign a contract defining what systems they can test and what actions they are allowed to take.",

      sectionTitle: "How Do People Learn Ethical Hacking?",
      content: [
        "Many ethical hackers start by using hands-on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, which provide safe environments to practice hacking skills legally. These platforms simulate real-world security challenges and help users understand how attackers think.",
        "Most ethical hackers also use a special Linux distribution called Kali Linux, which comes pre-installed with hundreds of hacking tools used by security professionals and cybercriminals alike. While advanced hackers may develop their own tools, many common attacks are performed using these pre-existing tools, making Kali Linux an essential learning environment.",

      content: [
        "Small businesses may not have the budget for full penetration tests, but they can still improve security by using free security tools, hiring ethical hackers for basic assessments, and educating employees on common attack methods.",
        "Some practical steps include running automated vulnerability scans, testing employee awareness with phishing simulations, and securing critical business accounts with multi-factor authentication. For example, a small law firm could use a free website security scanner to check for weak points in its client portal before investing in a full penetration test.",
